Interrupt() method :
A thread in a sleeping or waiting state can be interrupted by another thread with the help of the interrupt() method of the Thread class.
The interrupt() method throws InterruptedException.
The interrupt() method will not throw the InterruptedException if the thread is not in the sleeping/blocked state, but the interrupt flag will be changed to true.

Syntax :
    Public void interrupt()


Different scenarios where Interrupt() method can be used:
Case 1: Interrupting a thread that doesnâ€™t stop working :
class CWH1 extends Thread{
    public void run(){
        try {
            for (int i=0;i<5;i++){
                System.out.println("Child Thread");
                Thread.sleep(4000); // Child thread is put to sleep for 4000ms. As soon as child thread goes to sleep main thread interrupts it. And, InterruptedException is generated which is handled by the catch block.//

            }
                    }
                    catch (InterruptedException e)
                    {
                    System.out.println("Child Thread Interrupted");
                    }
                    System.out.println("Thread is running");

                    }
                    }

public class CWH extends Thread{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CWH1 t= new CWH1();
        t.start();
        t.interrupt();
        System.out.println("Main Thread");

    }
}


Join() method In Java :
The join() method in Java allows one thread to wait until the execution of some other specified thread is completed.
If t is a Thread object whose thread is currently executing, then t.join() causes the current thread to pause execution until t's thread terminates.
Join() method puts the current thread on wait until the thread on which it is called is dead.
    Syntax :    public final void join()

    Sleep() Method :
The sleep() method in Java is useful to put a thread to sleep for a specified amount of time.
When we put a thread to sleep, the thread scheduler picks and executes another thread in the queue.
Sleep() method returns void.
sleep() method can be used for any thread, including the main() thread also.
Syntax :
    public static void sleep(long milliseconds)throws InterruptedException
    public static void sleep(long milliseconds, int nanos)throws InterruptedException
Parameters Passed To Sleep() Method :
    long millisecond: Time in milliseconds for which thread will sleep.
    nanos : Ranges from [0,999999]. Additional time in nanoseconds.
Example :
    import java.io.*;
import java.lang.Thread;
public class cwh {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        try {
            for (int i = 1; i <=5; i++) {
                Thread.sleep(2000);
                System.out.println(i);
            }
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e);
        }
    }
}
