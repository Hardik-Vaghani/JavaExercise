    1. It can contain abstract and non-abstract method                  	                It can only contain abstract methods. We do not need to use the "abstract" keyword in interface methods because the interface is implicitly abstract.
    2. abstract keyword is used to declare an abstract class.           	                interface keyword is used to declare an interface.
    3.  A sub-class extends the abstract class by using the "extends" keyword.  	        The "implements" keyword is used to implement an interface.
    4. A abstract class in Java can have class members like private, protected, etc. 	    Members of a Java interface are public by default.
    5. Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.                     	        Multiple inheritance is achieved in Java by using the interface.
