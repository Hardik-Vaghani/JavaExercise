Just like we have some rules that we follow to speak English (the grammar), we have some rules to follow while writing a Java program. This set of these rules is called syntax. Itâ€™s like Vocabulary and Grammar of Java.

Variables=>
A variable is a container that stores a value.
This value can be changed during the execution of the program.
Example: int number = 8; (Here, int is a data type, the number is the variable name, and 8 is the value it contains/stores).
Rules for declaring a variable name


We can choose a name while declaring a Java variable if the following rules are followed:

Must not begin with a digit. (E.g., 1arry is an invalid variable)
Name is case sensitive. (Harry and harry are different)
Should not be a keyword (like Void).
White space is not allowed. (int Code With Harry is invalid)
Can contain alphabets, $character, _character, and digits if the other conditions are met.

Data Types=>
Data types in Java fall under the following categories

Primitive Data Types (Intrinsic)
Non-Primitive Data Types (Derived)
Primitive Data Types
Java is statically typed, i.e., variables must be declared before use. Java supports 8 primitive data types:
