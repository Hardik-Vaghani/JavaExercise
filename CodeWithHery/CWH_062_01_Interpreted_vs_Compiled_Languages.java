 /*
 The interpreter translates one statement at a time into machine code. On the other hand, the compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole of it into machine code

Interpreter :
    one statement at a time
    An interpreter is needed every time
    Partial execution if an error occurs in the program.
    Easy for programmers.

Compiler :
    Entire program at a time
    Once compiled, it is not needed
    No execution if an error occurs
    Usually not as easy as interpreted once
